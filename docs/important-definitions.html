Definitions</h1></header><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Term</strong></th><th><strong>Definition</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A/B testing</td><td>A statistical way of comparing two (or more) techniques, typically an incumbent against a new rival. A/B testing aims to determine not only which technique performs better but also to understand whether the difference is statistically significant. A/B testing usually considers only two techniques using one measurement, but it can be applied to any finite number of techniques and measures.</td></tr><tr><td>accuracy</td><td>The fraction of predictions that a classification model got right. In multi-class classification , accuracy is defined as follows:</td></tr><tr><td>activation function</td><td>A function (for example, ReLU or sigmoid ) that takes in the weighted sum of all of the inputs from the previous layer and then generates and passes an output value (typically nonlinear) to the next layer.</td></tr><tr><td>active learning</td><td>A training approach in which the algorithm chooses some of the data it learns from. Active learning is particularly valuable when labeled examples are scarce or expensive to obtain. Instead of blindly seeking a diverse range of labeled examples, an active learning algorithm selectively seeks the particular range of examples it needs for learning.</td></tr><tr><td>AdaGrad</td><td>A sophisticated gradient descent algorithm that rescales the gradients of each parameter, effectively giving each parameter an independent learning rate . For a full explanation, see this paper .</td></tr><tr><td>AR</td><td>Abbreviation for augmented reality .</td></tr><tr><td>area under the PR curve</td><td>See PR AUC (Area under the PR Curve) .</td></tr><tr><td>area under the ROC curve</td><td>See AUC (Area under the ROC curve) .</td></tr><tr><td>artificial general intelligence</td><td>A non-human mechanism that demonstrates a broad range of problem solving, creativity, and adaptability. For example, a program demonstrating artificial general intelligence could translate text, compose symphonies, and excel at games that have not yet been invented.</td></tr><tr><td>artificial intelligence</td><td>A non-human program or model that can solve sophisticated tasks. For example, a program or model that translates text or a program or model that identifies diseases from radiologic images both exhibit artificial intelligence.</td></tr><tr><td>AUC (Area under the ROC Curve)</td><td>An evaluation metric that considers all possible classification thresholds .</td></tr><tr><td>average precision</td><td>A metric for summarizing the performance of a ranked sequence of results. Average precision is calculated by taking the average of the precision values for each relevant result (each result in the ranked list where the recall increases relative to the previous result).</td></tr><tr><td>backpropagation</td><td>The primary algorithm for performing gradient descent on neural networks . First, the output values of each node are calculated (and cached) in a forward pass. Then, the partial derivative of the error with respect to each parameter is calculated in a backward pass through the graph.</td></tr><tr><td>bag of words</td><td>A representation of the words in a phrase or passage, irrespective of order. For example, bag of words represents the following three phrases identically:</td></tr><tr><td>baseline</td><td>A model used as a reference point for comparing how well another model (typically, a more complex one) is performing. For example, a logistic regression model might serve as a good baseline for a deep model .</td></tr><tr><td>batch</td><td>The set of examples used in one iteration (that is, one gradient update) of model training .</td></tr><tr><td>batch normalization</td><td>Normalizing the input or output of the activation functions in a hidden layer . Batch normalization can provide the following benefits:</td></tr><tr><td>batch size</td><td>The number of examples in a batch . For example, the batch size of SGD is 1, while the batch size of a mini-batch is usually between 10 and 1000. Batch size is usually fixed during training and inference ; however, TensorFlow does permit dynamic batch sizes.</td></tr><tr><td>Bayesian neural network</td><td>A probabilistic neural network that accounts for uncertainty in weights and outputs. A standard neural network regression model typically predicts a scalar value; for example, a model predicts a house price of 853,000. By contrast, a Bayesian neural network predicts a distribution of values; for example, a model predicts a house price of 853,000 with a standard deviation of 67,200. A Bayesian neural network relies on Bayes&#x27; Theorem to calculate uncertainties in weights and predictions. A Bayesian neural network can be useful when it is important to quantify uncertainty, such as in models related to pharmaceuticals. Bayesian neural networks can also help prevent overfitting .</td></tr><tr><td>bias (math)</td><td>An intercept or offset from an origin. Bias (also known as the bias term ) is referred to as b or w 0 in machine learning models. For example, bias is the b in the following formula:</td></tr><tr><td>binary classification</td><td>A type of classification task that outputs one of two mutually exclusive classes .

For instance, linear algebra requires that the two operands in a matrix addition operation must have the same dimensions. Consequently, you can&#x27;t add a matrix of shape (m, n) to a vector of length n. Broadcasting enables this operation by virtually expanding the vector of length n to a matrix of shape (m,n) by replicating the same values down each column.</td></tr><tr><td>bucketing</td><td>Converting a (usually continuous ) feature into multiple binary features called buckets or bins, typically based on value range. For example, instead of representing temperature as a single continuous floating-point feature, you could chop ranges of temperatures into discrete bins. Given temperature data sensitive to a tenth of a degree, all temperatures between 0.0 and 15.0 degrees could be put into one bin, 15.1 to 30.0 degrees could be a second bin, and 30.1 to 50.0 degrees could be a third bin.</td></tr><tr><td>calibration layer</td><td>A post-prediction adjustment, typically to account for prediction bias . The adjusted predictions and probabilities should match the distribution of an observed set of labels.</td></tr><tr><td>candidate sampling</td><td>A training-time optimization in which a probability is calculated for all the positive labels, using, for example, softmax , but only for a random sample of negative labels. For example, if we have an example labeled beagle and dog candidate sampling computes the predicted probabilities and corresponding loss terms for the beagle and dog class outputs in addition to a random subset of the remaining classes ( cat , lollipop , fence ). The idea is that the negative classes can learn from less frequent negative reinforcement as long as positive classes always get proper positive reinforcement, and this is indeed observed empirically. The motivation for candidate sampling is a computational efficiency win from not computing predictions for all negatives.</td></tr><tr><td>categorical data</td><td>Features having a discrete set of possible values. For example, consider a categorical feature named house style , which has a discrete set of three possible values: Tudor, ranch, colonial . By representing house style as categorical data, the model can learn the separate impacts of Tudor , ranch , and colonial on house price.</td></tr><tr><td>checkpoint</td><td>Data that captures the state of the variables of a model at a particular time.

Compare with regression model .</td></tr><tr><td>classification threshold</td><td>A scalar-value criterion that is applied to a model&#x27;s predicted score in order to separate the positive class from the negative class . Used when mapping logistic regression results to binary classification . For example, consider a logistic regression model that determines the probability of a given email message being spam. If the classification threshold is 0.9, then logistic regression values above 0.9 are classified as spam and those below 0.9 are classified as not spam .</td></tr><tr><td>class-imbalanced dataset</td><td>A binary classification problem in which the labels for the two classes have significantly different frequencies. For example, a disease dataset in which 0.0001 of examples have positive labels and 0.9999 have negative labels is a class-imbalanced problem, but a football game predictor in which 0.51 of examples label one team winning and 0.49 label the other team winning is not a class-imbalanced problem.</td></tr><tr><td>clipping</td><td>A technique for handling outliers . Specifically, reducing feature values that are greater than a set maximum value down to that maximum value. Also, increasing feature values that are less than a specific minimum value up to that minimum value.</td></tr><tr><td>co-adaptation</td><td>When neurons predict patterns in training data by relying almost exclusively on outputs of specific other neurons instead of relying on the network&#x27;s behavior as a whole. When the patterns that cause co-adaption are not present in validation data, then co-adaptation causes overfitting. Dropout regularization reduces co-adaptation because dropout ensures neurons cannot rely solely on specific other neurons.</td></tr><tr><td>confusion matrix</td><td>An NxN table that summarizes how successful a classification model&#x27;s predictions were; that is, the correlation between the label and the model&#x27;s classification. One axis of a confusion matrix is the label that the model predicted, and the other axis is the actual label. N represents the number of classes . In a binary classification problem, N=2. For example, here is a sample confusion matrix for a binary classification problem:</td></tr><tr><td>continuous feature</td><td>A floating-point feature with an infinite range of possible values. Contrast with discrete feature .</td></tr><tr><td>convenience sampling</td><td>Using a dataset not gathered scientifically in order to run quick experiments. Later on, it&#x27;s essential to switch to a scientifically gathered dataset.</td></tr><tr><td>convergence</td><td>Informally, often refers to a state reached during training in which training loss and validation loss change very little or not at all with each iteration after a certain number of iterations. In other words, a model reaches convergence when additional training on the current data will not improve the model. In deep learning , loss values sometimes stay constant or nearly so for many iterations before finally descending, temporarily producing a false sense of convergence.</td></tr><tr><td>convex function</td><td>A function in which the region above the graph of the function is a convex set . The prototypical convex function is shaped something like the letter U . For example, the following are all convex functions:</td></tr><tr><td>convex optimization</td><td>The process of using mathematical techniques such as gradient descent to find the minimum of a convex function .

For example, in the following image representing a binary classification problem, the decision boundary is the frontier between the orange class and the blue class:</td></tr><tr><td>decision threshold</td><td>Synonym for classification threshold .</td></tr><tr><td>decision tree</td><td>A model represented as a sequence of branching statements. For example, the following over-simplified decision tree branches a few times to predict the price of a house (in thousands of USD).

More formally, discriminative models define the conditional probability of an output given the features and weights; that is:</td></tr><tr><td>discriminator</td><td>A system that determines whether examples are real or fake.</td></tr><tr><td>dropout regularization</td><td>A form of regularization useful in training neural networks . Dropout regularization works by removing a random selection of a fixed number of the units in a network layer for a single gradient step. The more units dropped out, the stronger the regularization. This is analogous to training the network to emulate an exponentially large ensemble of smaller networks. For full details, see Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting .</td></tr><tr><td>dynamic model</td><td>A model that is trained online in a continuously updating fashion. That is, data is continuously entering the model.</td></tr><tr><td>early stopping</td><td>A method for regularization that involves ending model training before training loss finishes decreasing.

Typically, an embedding is a translation of a high-dimensional vector into a low-dimensional space. For example, you can represent the words in an English sentence in either of the following two ways:</td></tr><tr><td>embedding space</td><td>The d-dimensional vector space that features from a higher-dimensional vector space are mapped to.

For example, postal code, property size, and property condition might comprise a simple feature set for a model that predicts housing prices.</td></tr><tr><td>feature vector</td><td>The list of feature values representing an example passed into a model.</td></tr><tr><td>federated learning</td><td>A distributed machine learning approach that trains machine learning models using decentralized examples residing on devices such as smartphones. In federated learning, a subset of devices downloads the current model from a central coordinating server. The devices use the examples stored on the devices to make improvements to the model. The devices then upload the model improvements (but not the training examples) to the coordinating server, where they are aggregated with other updates to yield an improved global model. After the aggregation, the model updates computed by devices are no longer needed, and can be discarded.</td></tr><tr><td>feedback loop</td><td>In machine learning, a situation in which a model&#x27;s predictions influence the training data for the same model or another model. For example, a model that recommends movies will influence the movies that people see, which will then influence subsequent movie recommendation models.</td></tr><tr><td>feedforward neural network (FFN)</td><td>A neural network without cyclic or recursive connections.

For binary classification, the hinge loss function is defined as follows:</td></tr><tr><td>holdout data</td><td>Examples intentionally not used (&quot;held out&quot;) during training. The validation dataset and test dataset are examples of holdout data. Holdout data helps evaluate your model&#x27;s ability to generalize to data other than the data it was trained on. The loss on the holdout set provides a better estimate of the loss on an unseen dataset than does the loss on the training set.</td></tr><tr><td>hyperparameter</td><td>The &quot;knobs&quot; that you tweak during successive runs of training a model. For example, learning rate is a hyperparameter.</td></tr><tr><td>hyperplane</td><td>A boundary that separates a space into two subspaces.

An i.i.d. is the ideal gas of machine learning—a useful mathematical construct but almost never exactly found in the real world. For example, the distribution of visitors to a web page may be i.i.d. over a brief window of time; that is, the distribution doesn&#x27;t change during that brief window and one person&#x27;s visit is generally independent of another&#x27;s visit.

KSVMs uses a loss function called hinge loss .</td></tr><tr><td>L 1 loss</td><td>Loss function based on the absolute value of the difference between the values that a model is predicting and the actual values of the labels . L 1 loss is less sensitive to outliers than L 2 loss .</td></tr><tr><td>L 1 regularization</td><td>A type of regularization that penalizes weights in proportion to the sum of the absolute values of the weights. In models relying on sparse features , L 1 regularization helps drive the weights of irrelevant or barely relevant features to exactly 0, which removes those features from the model. Contrast with L 2 regularization .</td></tr><tr><td>L 2 loss</td><td>See squared loss .</td></tr><tr><td>L 2 regularization</td><td>A type of regularization that penalizes weights in proportion to the sum of the squares of the weights. L 2 regularization helps drive outlier weights (those with high positive or low negative values) closer to 0 but not quite to 0. (Contrast with L1 regularization .) L 2 regularization always improves generalization in linear models.</td></tr><tr><td>label</td><td>In supervised learning, the &quot;answer&quot; or &quot;result&quot; portion of an example . Each example in a labeled dataset consists of one or more features and a label. For instance, in a housing dataset, the features might include the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the age of the house, while the label might be the house&#x27;s price. In a spam detection dataset, the features might include the subject line, the sender, and the email message itself, while the label would probably be either &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not spam.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>labeled example</td><td>An example that contains features and a label .

For example, given a model that classifies examples as animal, vegetable, or mineral, a one-vs.-all solution would provide the following three separate binary classifiers:</td></tr><tr><td>online inference</td><td>Generating predictions on demand. Contrast with offline inference .</td></tr><tr><td>optimizer</td><td>A specific implementation of the gradient descent algorithm. TensorFlow&#x27;s base class for optimizers is tf.train.Optimizer . Popular optimizers include:</td></tr><tr><td>outliers</td><td>Values distant from most other values. In machine learning, any of the following are outliers:</td></tr><tr><td>output layer</td><td>The &quot;final&quot; layer of a neural network.

Contrast with hyperparameter .</td></tr><tr><td>parameter update</td><td>The operation of adjusting a model&#x27;s parameters during training, typically within a single iteration of gradient descent .</td></tr><tr><td>partial derivative</td><td>A derivative in which all but one of the variables is considered a constant. For example, the partial derivative of f(x, y) with respect to x is the derivative of f considered as a function of x alone (that is, keeping y constant). The partial derivative of f with respect to x focuses only on how x is changing and ignores all other variables in the equation.</td></tr><tr><td>partitioning strategy</td><td>The algorithm by which variables are divided across parameter servers .</td></tr><tr><td>perceptron</td><td>A system (either hardware or software) that takes in one or more input values, runs a function on the weighted sum of the inputs, and computes a single output value. In machine learning, the function is typically nonlinear, such as ReLU , sigmoid , or tanh. For example, the following perceptron relies on the sigmoid function to process three input values:</td></tr><tr><td>performance</td><td>Overloaded term with the following meanings:</td></tr><tr><td>perplexity</td><td>One measure of how well a model is accomplishing its task. For example, suppose your task is to read the first few letters of a word a user is typing on a smartphone keyboard, and to offer a list of possible completion words. Perplexity, P, for this task is approximately the number of guesses you need to offer in order for your list to contain the actual word the user is trying to type.</td></tr><tr><td>pipeline</td><td>The infrastructure surrounding a machine learning algorithm. A pipeline includes gathering the data, putting the data into training data files, training one or more models, and exporting the models to production.</td></tr><tr><td>positive class</td><td>In binary classification , the two possible classes are labeled as positive and negative. The positive outcome is the thing we&#x27;re testing for. (Admittedly, we&#x27;re simultaneously testing for both outcomes, but play along.)

For example, the following figure divides 44 points into 4 buckets, each of which contains 11 points. In order for each bucket in the figure to contain the same number of points, some buckets span a different width of x-values.</td></tr><tr><td>quantization</td><td>An algorithm that implements quantile bucketing on a particular feature in a dataset .</td></tr><tr><td>random forest</td><td>An ensemble approach to finding the decision tree that best fits the training data by creating many decision trees and then determining the &quot;average&quot; one. The &quot;random&quot; part of the term refers to building each of the decision trees from a random selection of features; the &quot;forest&quot; refers to the set of decision trees.</td></tr><tr><td>rank (ordinality)</td><td>The ordinal position of a class in a machine learning problem that categorizes classes from highest to lowest. For example, a behavior ranking system could rank a dog&#x27;s rewards from highest (a steak) to lowest (wilted kale).</td></tr><tr><td>rater</td><td>A human who provides labels in examples .

See also AUC .</td></tr><tr><td>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</td><td>The square root of the Mean Squared Error .</td></tr><tr><td>scalar</td><td>A single number or a single string that can be represented as a tensor of rank 0. For example, the following lines of code each create one scalar in TensorFlow:</td></tr><tr><td>scaling</td><td>A commonly used practice in feature engineering to tame a feature&#x27;s range of values to match the range of other features in the dataset. For example, suppose that you want all floating-point features in the dataset to have a range of 0 to 1. Given a particular feature&#x27;s range of 0 to 500, you could scale that feature by dividing each value by 500.</td></tr><tr><td>scikit-learn</td><td>A popular open-source machine learning platform. See <a href="http://www.scikit-learn.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.scikit-learn.org</a> .</td></tr><tr><td>semi-supervised learning</td><td>Training a model on data where some of the training examples have labels but others don’t. One technique for semi-supervised learning is to infer labels for the unlabeled examples, and then to train on the inferred labels to create a new model. Semi-supervised learning can be useful if labels are expensive to obtain but unlabeled examples are plentiful.</td></tr><tr><td>sentiment analysis</td><td>Using statistical or machine learning algorithms to determine a group&#x27;s overall attitude—positive or negative—toward a service, product, organization, or topic. For example, using natural language understanding , an algorithm could perform sentiment analysis on the textual feedback from a university course to determine the degree to which students generally liked or disliked the course.</td></tr><tr><td>serving</td><td>A synonym for inferring .</td></tr><tr><td>shape (Tensor)</td><td>The number of elements in each dimension of a tensor.

The sigmoid function has the following formula:</td></tr><tr><td>softmax</td><td>A function that provides probabilities for each possible class in a multi-class classification model . The probabilities add up to exactly 1.0. For example, softmax might determine that the probability of a particular image being a dog at 0.9, a cat at 0.08, and a horse at 0.02. (Also called full softmax .)</td></tr><tr><td>sparse feature</td><td>Feature vector whose values are predominately zero or empty. For example, a vector containing a single 1 value and a million 0 values is sparse. As another example, words in a search query could also be a sparse feature—there are many possible words in a given language, but only a few of them occur in a given query.</td></tr><tr><td>sparse representation</td><td>A representation of a tensor that only stores nonzero elements.</td></tr><tr><td>sparse vector</td><td>A vector whose values are mostly zeroes. See also sparse feature .</td></tr><tr><td>sparsity</td><td>The number of elements set to zero (or null) in a vector or matrix divided by the total number of entries in that vector or matrix. For example, consider a 10x10 matrix in which 98 cells contain zero. The calculation of sparsity is as follows:</td></tr><tr><td>squared hinge loss</td><td>The square of the hinge loss . Squared hinge loss penalizes outliers more harshly than regular hinge loss.</td></tr><tr><td>squared loss</td><td>The loss function used in linear regression . (Also known as L 2 Loss .) This function calculates the squares of the difference between a model&#x27;s predicted value for a labeled example and the actual value of the label . Due to squaring, this loss function amplifies the influence of bad predictions. That is, squared loss reacts more strongly to outliers than L 1 loss .</td></tr><tr><td>static model</td><td>A model that is trained offline.</td></tr><tr><td>stationarity</td><td>A property of data in a dataset, in which the data distribution stays constant across one or more dimensions. Most commonly, that dimension is time, meaning that data exhibiting stationarity doesn&#x27;t change over time. For example, data that exhibits stationarity doesn&#x27;t change from September to December.</td></tr><tr><td>step</td><td>A forward and backward evaluation of one batch .</td></tr><tr><td>step size</td><td>Synonym for learning rate .</td></tr><tr><td>stochastic gradient descent (SGD)</td><td>A gradient descent algorithm in which the batch size is one.

Supervised machine learning is analogous to a student learning a subject by studying a set of questions and their corresponding answers. After mastering the mapping between questions and answers, the student can then provide answers to new (never-before-seen) questions on the same topic. Compare with unsupervised machine learning .</td></tr><tr><td>synthetic feature</td><td>A feature not present among the input features, but created from one or more of them. Kinds of synthetic features include:</td></tr><tr><td>target</td><td>Synonym for label .</td></tr><tr><td>temporal data</td><td>Data recorded at different points in time. For example, winter coat sales recorded for each day of the year would be temporal data.</td></tr><tr><td>test set</td><td>The subset of the dataset that you use to test your model after the model has gone through initial vetting by the validation set.</td></tr><tr><td>tower</td><td>A component of a deep neural network that is itself a deep neural network without an output layer.

For example, in multi-task learning, a single model solves multiple tasks, such as a deep model that has different output nodes for different tasks. Transfer learning might involve transferring knowledge from the solution of a simpler task to a more complex one, or involve transferring knowledge from a task where there is more data to one where there is less data.</td></tr><tr><td>true negative (TN)</td><td>An example in which the model correctly predicted the negative class . For example, the model inferred that a particular email message was not spam, and that email message really was not spam.</td></tr><tr><td>true positive (TP)</td><td>An example in which the model correctly predicted the positive class . For example, the model inferred that a particular email message was spam, and that email message really was spam.</td></tr><tr><td>true positive rate (TPR)</td><td>Synonym for recall . That is:</td></tr><tr><td>underfitting</td><td>Producing a model with poor predictive ability because the model hasn&#x27;t captured the complexity of the training data. Many problems can cause underfitting, including:</td></tr><tr><td>unlabeled example</td><td>An example that contains features but no label . Unlabeled examples are the input to inference . In semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, unlabeled examples are used during training.</td></tr><tr><td>upweighting</td><td>Applying a weight to the downsampled class equal to the factor by which you downsampled.</td></tr><tr><td>validation</td><td>A process used, as part of training , to evaluate the quality of a machine learning model using the validation set . Because the validation set is disjoint from the training set, validation helps ensure that the model’s performance generalizes beyond the training set.</td></tr><tr><td>validation set</td><td>A subset of the dataset—disjoint from the training set—used in validation .</td></tr><tr><td>Wasserstein loss</td><td>One of the loss functions commonly used in generative adversarial networks , based on the earth-mover&#x27;s distance between the distribution of generated data and real data.</td></tr><tr><td>weight</td><td>A coefficient for a feature in a linear model, or an edge in a deep network. The goal of training a linear model is to determine the ideal weight for each feature. If a weight is 0, then its corresponding feature does not contribute to the model.</td></tr><tr><td>wide model</td><td>A linear model that typically has many sparse input features . We refer to it as &quot;wide&quot; since such a model is a special type of neural network with a large number of inputs that connect directly to the output node. Wide models are often easier to debug and inspect than deep models. Although wide models cannot express nonlinearities through hidden layers , they can use transformations such as feature crossing and bucketization to model nonlinearities in different ways.</td></tr><tr><td>width</td><td>The number of neurons in a particular layer of a neural network .</td></tr></tbody></table></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/Onenine-AI/onenine-ai.github.io/tree/dev/docs/important-definitions.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_dcUD" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_foO9"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/organising-projects/organising-projects-best-practices"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Best Practices</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/use-cases/use-cases-intro"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Introduction</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Resources</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs">Documentation</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/tutorials">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://onenine.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/user/login?destination=portals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Support Request<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://ai.onenine.cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Visit Our Site<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://onenine.cloud/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">OneNine AI Site<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/onenine-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">LinkedIn<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 OneNine AI .
