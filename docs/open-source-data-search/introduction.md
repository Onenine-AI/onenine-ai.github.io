## **Introduction**

Open data is research data that is freely available on the Internet for anyone to download, modify, and distribute without any legal or financial restrictions. An open data portal is any online platform which supports users in accessing collections of open data.

## **Features of Open Data**

### Availability and access
  - The data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.

### Reuse and redistribution
  - The data must be provided under terms that permit reuse and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets. The data must be machine-readable.

### Universal participation
  - Everyone must be able to use, reuse and redistribute — there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, ‘non-commercial’ restrictions that would prevent ‘commercial’ use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed.
