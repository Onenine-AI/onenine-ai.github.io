|  A/B testing                                      | A statistical way of comparing two (or more) techniques, typically an incumbent against a new rival. A/B testing aims to determine not only which technique performs better but also to understand whether the difference is statistically significant. A/B testing usually considers only two techniques using one measurement, but it can be applied to any finite number of techniques and measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  accuracy                                         |  The fraction of predictions that a classification model got right. In multi-class classification , accuracy is defined as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| activation function                               |  A function (for example, ReLU or sigmoid ) that takes in the weighted sum of all of the inputs from the previous layer and then generates and passes an output value (typically nonlinear) to the next layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| active learning                                   |  A training approach in which the algorithm chooses some of the data it learns from. Active learning is particularly valuable when labeled examples are scarce or expensive to obtain. Instead of blindly seeking a diverse range of labeled examples, an active learning algorithm selectively seeks the particular range of examples it needs for learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  batch size                                       |  The number of examples in a batch . For example, the batch size of SGD is 1, while the batch size of a mini-batch is usually between 10 and 1000. Batch size is usually fixed during training and inference ; however, TensorFlow does permit dynamic batch sizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  Bayesian neural network                          |  A probabilistic neural network that accounts for uncertainty in weights and outputs. A standard neural network regression model typically predicts a scalar value; for example, a model predicts a house price of 853,000. By contrast, a Bayesian neural network predicts a distribution of values; for example, a model predicts a house price of 853,000 with a standard deviation of 67,200. A Bayesian neural network relies on Bayes' Theorem to calculate uncertainties in weights and predictions. A Bayesian neural network can be useful when it is important to quantify uncertainty, such as in models related to pharmaceuticals. Bayesian neural networks can also help prevent overfitting .                                                                               |

|  boosting                                         |  A machine learning technique that iteratively combines a set of simple and not very accurate classifiers (referred to as "weak" classifiers) into a classifier with high accuracy (a "strong" classifier) by upweighting the examples that the model is currently misclassfying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  broadcasting                                     |  Expanding the shape of an operand in a matrix math operation to dimensions compatible for that operation. For instance, linear algebra requires that the two operands in a matrix addition operation must have the same dimensions. Consequently, you can't add a matrix of shape (m, n) to a vector of length n. Broadcasting enables this operation by virtually expanding the vector of length n to a matrix of shape (m,n) by replicating the same values down each column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  bucketing                                        |  Converting a (usually continuous ) feature into multiple binary features called buckets or bins, typically based on value range. For example, instead of representing temperature as a single continuous floating-point feature, you could chop ranges of temperatures into discrete bins. Given temperature data sensitive to a tenth of a degree, all temperatures between 0.0 and 15.0 degrees could be put into one bin, 15.1 to 30.0 degrees could be a second bin, and 30.1 to 50.0 degrees could be a third bin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  calibration layer                                |  A post-prediction adjustment, typically to account for prediction bias . The adjusted predictions and probabilities should match the distribution of an observed set of labels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  candidate sampling                               |  A training-time optimization in which a probability is calculated for all the positive labels, using, for example, softmax , but only for a random sample of negative labels. For example, if we have an example labeled beagle and dog candidate sampling computes the predicted probabilities and corresponding loss terms for the beagle and dog class outputs in addition to a random subset of the remaining classes ( cat , lollipop , fence ). The idea is that the negative classes can learn from less frequent negative reinforcement as long as positive classes always get proper positive reinforcement, and this is indeed observed empirically. The motivation for candidate sampling is a computational efficiency win from not computing predictions for all negatives.  |
|  categorical data                                 |  Features having a discrete set of possible values. For example, consider a categorical feature named house style , which has a discrete set of three possible values: Tudor, ranch, colonial . By representing house style as categorical data, the model can learn the separate impacts of Tudor , ranch , and colonial on house price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  checkpoint                                       |  Data that captures the state of the variables of a model at a particular time. Checkpoints enable exporting model weights , as well as performing training across multiple sessions. Checkpoints also enable training to continue past errors (for example, job preemption). Note that the graph itself is not included in a checkpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  class                                            |  One of a set of enumerated target values for a label. For example, in a binary classification model that detects spam, the two classes are spam and not spam . In a multi-class classification model that identifies dog breeds, the classes would be poodle , beagle , pug , and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  classification model                             |  A type of machine learning model for distinguishing among two or more discrete classes. For example, a natural language processing classification model could determine whether an input sentence was in French, Spanish, or Italian. Compare with regression model .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  classification threshold                         |  A scalar-value criterion that is applied to a model's predicted score in order to separate the positive class from the negative class . Used when mapping logistic regression results to binary classification . For example, consider a logistic regression model that determines the probability of a given email message being spam. If the classification threshold is 0.9, then logistic regression values above 0.9 are classified as spam and those below 0.9 are classified as not spam .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  class-imbalanced dataset                         |  A binary classification problem in which the labels for the two classes have significantly different frequencies. For example, a disease dataset in which 0.0001 of examples have positive labels and 0.9999 have negative labels is a class-imbalanced problem, but a football game predictor in which 0.51 of examples label one team winning and 0.49 label the other team winning is not a class-imbalanced problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  clipping                                         |  A technique for handling outliers . Specifically, reducing feature values that are greater than a set maximum value down to that maximum value. Also, increasing feature values that are less than a specific minimum value up to that minimum value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  co-adaptation                                    |  When neurons predict patterns in training data by relying almost exclusively on outputs of specific other neurons instead of relying on the network's behavior as a whole. When the patterns that cause co-adaption are not present in validation data, then co-adaptation causes overfitting. Dropout regularization reduces co-adaptation because dropout ensures neurons cannot rely solely on specific other neurons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  confusion matrix                                 |  An NxN table that summarizes how successful a classification model's predictions were; that is, the correlation between the label and the model's classification. One axis of a confusion matrix is the label that the model predicted, and the other axis is the actual label. N represents the number of classes . In a binary classification problem, N=2. For example, here is a sample confusion matrix for a binary classification problem:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  convergence                                      |  Informally, often refers to a state reached during training in which training loss and validation loss change very little or not at all with each iteration after a certain number of iterations. In other words, a model reaches convergence when additional training on the current data will not improve the model. In deep learning , loss values sometimes stay constant or nearly so for many iterations before finally descending, temporarily producing a false sense of convergence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  dropout regularization                           |  A form of regularization useful in training neural networks . Dropout regularization works by removing a random selection of a fixed number of the units in a network layer for a single gradient step. The more units dropped out, the stronger the regularization. This is analogous to training the network to emulate an exponentially large ensemble of smaller networks.

|  federated learning                               |  A distributed machine learning approach that trains machine learning models using decentralized examples residing on devices such as smartphones. In federated learning, a subset of devices downloads the current model from a central coordinating server. The devices use the examples stored on the devices to make improvements to the model. The devices then upload the model improvements (but not the training examples) to the coordinating server, where they are aggregated with other updates to yield an improved global model. After the aggregation, the model updates computed by devices are no longer needed, and can be discarded.                                                                                                                                    |

When we switched to a deep neural network, accuracy went up to 98%."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  hidden layer                                     |  A synthetic layer in a neural network between the input layer (that is, the features) and the output layer (the prediction). Hidden layers typically contain an activation function (such as ReLU ) for training. A deep neural network contains more than one hidden layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  hinge loss                                       |  A family of loss functions for classification designed to find the decision boundary as distant as possible from each training example, thus maximizing the margin between examples and the boundary. KSVMs use hinge loss (or a related function, such as squared hinge loss). For binary classification, the hinge loss function is defined as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  holdout data                                     |  Examples intentionally not used ("held out") during training. The validation dataset and test dataset are examples of holdout data. Holdout data helps evaluate your model's ability to generalize to data other than the data it was trained on. The loss on the holdout set provides a better estimate of the loss on an unseen dataset than does the loss on the training set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  hyperparameter                                   |  The "knobs" that you tweak during successive runs of training a model. For example, learning rate is a hyperparameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  hyperplane                                       |  A boundary that separates a space into two subspaces. For example, a line is a hyperplane in two dimensions and a plane is a hyperplane in three dimensions. More typically in machine learning, a hyperplane is the boundary separating a high-dimensional space. Kernel Support Vector Machines use hyperplanes to separate positive classes from negative classes, often in a very high-dimensional space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) |  Data drawn from a distribution that doesn't change, and where each value drawn doesn't depend on values that have been drawn previously. An i.i.d. is the ideal gas of machine learning—a useful mathematical construct but almost never exactly found in the real world. For example, the distribution of visitors to a web page may be i.i.d. over a brief window of time; that is, the distribution doesn't change during that brief window and one person's visit is generally independent of another's visit. However, if you expand that window of time, seasonal differences in the web page's visitors may appear.                                                                                                                                                                |
|  inference                                        |  In machine learning, often refers to the process of making predictions by applying the trained model to unlabeled examples . In statistics, inference refers to the process of fitting the parameters of a distribution conditioned on some observed data.

By contrast, linear regression models and wide models are typically far more interpretable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  inter-rater agreement                            |  A measurement of how often human raters agree when doing a task. If raters disagree, the task instructions may need to be improved. Also sometimes called inter-annotator agreement or inter-rater reliability . See also Cohen's kappa , which is one of the most popular inter-rater agreement measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Kernel Support Vector Machines (KSVMs)            |  A classification algorithm that seeks to maximize the margin between positive and negative classes by mapping input data vectors to a higher dimensional space. For example, consider a classification problem in which the input dataset has a hundred features. To maximize the margin between positive and negative classes, a KSVM could internally map those features into a million-dimension space. KSVMs uses a loss function called hinge loss .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

L 1 loss is less sensitive to outliers than L 2 loss .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  L 1 regularization                               |  A type of regularization that penalizes weights in proportion to the sum of the absolute values of the weights. In models relying on sparse features , L 1 regularization helps drive the weights of irrelevant or barely relevant features to exactly 0, which removes those features from the model. Contrast with L 2 regularization .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  L 2 regularization                               |  A type of regularization that penalizes weights in proportion to the sum of the squares of the weights. L 2 regularization helps drive outlier weights (those with high positive or low negative values) closer to 0 but not quite to 0. (Contrast with L1 regularization .) L 2 regularization always improves generalization in linear models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  label                                            |  In supervised learning, the "answer" or "result" portion of an example . Each example in a labeled dataset consists of one or more features and a label. For instance, in a housing dataset, the features might include the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the age of the house, while the label might be the house's price. In a spam detection dataset, the features might include the subject line, the sender, and the email message itself, while the label would probably be either "spam" or "not spam."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

You can interpret the value between 0 and 1 in either of the following two ways:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  logits                                           |  The vector of raw (non-normalized) predictions that a classification model generates, which is ordinarily then passed to a normalization function. If the model is solving a multi-class classification problem, logits typically become an input to the softmax function. The softmax function then generates a vector of (normalized) probabilities with one value for each possible class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Within TensorFlow, model is an overloaded term, which can have either of the following two related meanings:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  model capacity                                   |  The complexity of problems that a model can learn. The more complex the problems that a model can learn, the higher the model’s capacity. A model’s capacity typically increases with the number of model parameters.

|  Momentum                                         | A sophisticated gradient descent algorithm in which a learning step depends not only on the derivative in the current step, but also on the derivatives of the step(s) that immediately preceded it. Momentum involves computing an exponentially weighted moving average of the gradients over time, analogous to momentum in physics. Momentum sometimes prevents learning from getting stuck in local minima.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  multi-class classification                       |  Classification problems that distinguish among more than two classes. For example, there are approximately 128 species of maple trees, so a model that categorized maple tree species would be multi-class. Conversely, a model that divided emails into only two categories ( spam and not spam ) would be a binary classification model .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  noise                                            | Broadly speaking, anything that obscures the signal in a dataset. Noise can be introduced into data in a variety of ways. For example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  normalization                                    | The process of converting an actual range of values into a standard range of values, typically -1 to +1 or 0 to 1. For example, suppose the natural range of a certain feature is 800 to 6,000. Through subtraction and division, you can normalize those values into the range -1 to +1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  numerical data                                   |  Features represented as integers or real-valued numbers. For example, in a real estate model, you would probably represent the size of a house (in square feet or square meters) as numerical data. Representing a feature as numerical data indicates that the feature's values have a mathematical relationship to each other and possibly to the label. For example, representing the size of a house as numerical data indicates that a 200 square-meter house is twice as large as a 100 square-meter house. Furthermore, the number of square meters in a house probably has some mathematical relationship to the price of the house.                                                                                                                                              |

|  partial derivative                               |  A derivative in which all but one of the variables is considered a constant. For example, the partial derivative of f(x, y) with respect to x is the derivative of f considered as a function of x alone (that is, keeping y constant). The partial derivative of f with respect to x focuses only on how x is changing and ignores all other variables in the equation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  pre-trained model                                |  Models or model components (such as embeddings ) that have been already been trained. Sometimes, you'll feed pre-trained embeddings into a neural network . Other times, your model will train the embeddings itself rather than rely on the pre-trained embeddings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  quantile bucketing                               |  Distributing a feature's values into buckets so that each bucket contains the same (or almost the same) number of examples.

For example, the following lines of code each create one scalar in TensorFlow:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  scaling                                          |  A commonly used practice in feature engineering to tame a feature's range of values to match the range of other features in the dataset. For example, suppose that you want all floating-point features in the dataset to have a range of 0 to 1. Given a particular feature's range of 0 to 500, you could scale that feature by dividing each value by 500.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  semi-supervised learning                         | Training a model on data where some of the training examples have labels but others don’t. One technique for semi-supervised learning is to infer labels for the unlabeled examples, and then to train on the inferred labels to create a new model. Semi-supervised learning can be useful if labels are expensive to obtain but unlabeled examples are plentiful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  sparsity                                         | The number of elements set to zero (or null) in a vector or matrix divided by the total number of entries in that vector or matrix. For example, consider a 10x10 matrix in which 98 cells contain zero. The calculation of sparsity is as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  squared loss                                     |  The loss function used in linear regression . (Also known as L 2 Loss .) This function calculates the squares of the difference between a model's predicted value for a labeled example and the actual value of the label . Due to squaring, this loss function amplifies the influence of bad predictions. That is, squared loss reacts more strongly to outliers than L 1 loss .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The goal of training a linear model is to determine the ideal weight for each feature. If a weight is 0, then its corresponding feature does not contribute to the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  wide model                                       |  A linear model that typically has many sparse input features . We refer to it as "wide" since such a model is a special type of neural network with a large number of inputs that connect directly to the output node. Wide models are often easier to debug and inspect than deep models. Although wide models cannot express nonlinearities through hidden layers , they can use transformations such as feature crossing and bucketization to model nonlinearities in different ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
