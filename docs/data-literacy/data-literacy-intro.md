Well, this is where Data Literacy comes in.

## What is Data Literacy?

Data Literacy is nothing but  the ability to read data, work with data, and communicate about data by putting it in proper context. Data Literacy is not just understanding and working with numbers, or numeracy. 
It is the overall understanding of source of the data, the applications of the data and the validity of the data. 
It is an intersection of Data Reading skills, Data management skills and data representation skills.
